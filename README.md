Company managers/employees should be able to use the system by logging into the system, that is, users are separate entities in the system. Users must enter the personal information of the customers and the information of the rented vehicle, and take the necessary actions to ensure that the vehicle is not rented and followed up during the rental period. Managers or employees should be able to enter the system from the web application and be able to rent. Customers, on the other hand, can view the company's existing and rentable vehicles on the web and even initiate a reservation or rental request. Password information of users and employees should be kept from developers.
